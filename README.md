1. ?
### Kaggle
1. Review 5 winning solutions. [list1](http://ndres.me/kaggle-past-solutions/), [list2](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/winning-solutions-of-kaggle-competitions), [list3](http://www.chioka.in/kaggle-competition-solutions/)
1. Study in-depth 2 winning solutions
### Specific stuff
* Motivation for inception block
* Understand inception v3 trick
* Understand Fully connected conv. Motivations: 1. Flexible input size, 2. Equivalent to sliding cnn.
* What exactly happens when I replace the dense layer of a pretrained model with a smaller one? You freeze the non-dense, and train the dense.
* Why *binary* cross entropy on segmentation model?
