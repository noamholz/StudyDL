## DL
### Courses
1. [Cs231]()
1. [Ng-deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
1. [Ng-CNN Tensorflow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow)
1. [Fast.ai courses](https://www.fast.ai/)
### GANs
1. general theory
1. existing algos review
### Detection
1. Yolo theory (anchors)
1. Mask-R-CNN evolution theory
1. Winning "magentiq" kaggle solution
### Kaggle
1. Review 5 winning solutions
1. Study in-depth 2 winning solutions
### Specific stuff
* Motivation for inception block
* Understand inception v3 trick
* Understand Fully connected conv. Motivations: 1. Flexible input size, 2. Equivalent to sliding cnn.
* What exactly happens when I replace the dense layer of a pretrained model with a smaller one? You freeze the non-dense, and train the dense.
* Why *binary* cross entropy on segmentation model?
